Make sure all features have tests.  use new testthat skip_on_cran() if slow

model list format for pmatrix.fs, totlos.fs. just need to form basepars.mat for given covariates

Redo custom documentation in vignette to be EV

Use testCoverage package, as in msm


OPTIONAL

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Delta method for survival - a lot of distribution-specific faff.

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate

CIs as grey bands not lines

#are these buggy in survreg::Surv?
#time <- ifelse(time == Inf, NA, time)
#time2 <- ifelse(time2 == -Inf, NA, time2)

Migrate doc to roxygen?

Newton-Raphson (analytic second derivs) available in maxLik::maxNR
