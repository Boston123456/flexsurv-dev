Warn about survival times of zero (or stop=start)

D can be non pos-def in QP (github #9).  Why does this happen?  At least back up to Cox routine if does.

Incomprehensible error if survival times negative, at least in flexsurvspline

Ongoing problems with Hessian in Weibull models (see p metcalfe example)


SURVREG

does 1/2 Surv indicator work, and TRUE/FALSE?  if so is n events reported correctly



OPTIONAL

Migrate doc to roxygen - Rd2roxygen package will help this
options(roxygen.comment = "##' ")   for ESS

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary.
   See surv2sampleComp package
Restricted SD in same way?

Tidy up summary functions, including bootstrap, covariate handling.

hsurvspline at x=0, currently zero, should it be limit as x reduces to 0?

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Residuals, e.g. Cox-Snell

abstract newdata thing - default to baseline

Delta method for survival - a lot of distribution-specific faff.

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate

CIs as grey bands not lines

#are these buggy in survreg::Surv?
#time <- ifelse(time == Inf, NA, time)
#time2 <- ifelse(time2 == -Inf, NA, time2)

Newton-Raphson (analytic second derivs) available in maxLik::maxNR

allow time-dependent covs to influence the hazard in pmatrix.fs

any role for pseudo-observations?  (residual plots? regressing functions of pars directly on covs?)
