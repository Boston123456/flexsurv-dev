quantiles at 0 and 1 are min and max: use in flexsurvspline   

CIs as grey bands not lines

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Make sure all features have tests


OPTIONAL

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate
