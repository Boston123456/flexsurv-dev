Make sure all features have tests.  use new testthat skip_on_cran() if slow

model list format for pmatrix.fs, totlos.fs. just need to form basepars.mat for given covariates


OPTIONAL

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Delta method for survival - a lot of faff. 

log-logistic built in: todo derivatives.  which parameterisation?
   shape, scale one is consistent with weibull link, eha and current
   manual
   S(t) = 1/(1 + (t/scale)^shape),   analog to weibull S(t) = exp(-(t/scale)^shape)
   though not with ActuDistns or Stata (though dweibull not same as stata)

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate

CIs as grey bands not lines

#are these buggy in survreg::Surv?
#time <- ifelse(time == Inf, NA, time)
#time2 <- ifelse(time2 == -Inf, NA, time2)

Migrate doc to roxygen?
