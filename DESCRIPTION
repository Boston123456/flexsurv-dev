Description: Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data, including the Royston-Parmar spline model, generalized gamma and generalized F distributions.   Any user-defined parametric distribution can be fitted, given at least an R function defining the probability density or hazard.  Produces cumulative incidence functions for multi-state modelling with the "mstate" package.
